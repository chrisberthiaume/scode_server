# scode_server
shell code based webserver

This should never be used.

Using only the power of bash, implement a multi-hosted website. Make sure to abuse the power of emebedded base64 images to make your website complete. I also suggest gzipping the site and adding that as a header.


Once again, don't use this code. But if you must, you should probably change your listening port so that sudo isn't needed.
